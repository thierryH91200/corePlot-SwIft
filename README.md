### Iâ€™ve googled but not been able to find out what the swift equivalent to respondsToSelector: is.

This is the only thing I could find (Swift alternative to respondsToSelector:) but isnâ€™t too relevant in my case as its checking the existence of the delegate, I donâ€™t have a delegate I just want to check if a new API exists or not when running on the device and if not fall back to a previous version of the api.
